# Implementing-a-general-Neural-Network
In this project i tried to build a Neural Network from scratch to understand the concepts and maths behind the Neural Network

## Motivation
Got the idea from the course on Deep Learning(CS7015) at NPTEL-NOC IITM taught by *Prof. Mitesh M. Khapra*.

## Acknowledgements
  *Most of this material is based on the article “Deep Learning in Neural Networks:An Overview” by J. Schmidhuber[1]*

  *Used various documentation part from the lecture slides of CS7015 which are available online.*[2]

  The errors, if any, are due to me and I apologize for them.

  Feel free to contact me if you think certain portions need to be corrected (pleaseprovide appropriate references)

## Goal
To achive a self implemented nural network.
